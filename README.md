# Compiler Project

This was a personal academic project completed during my time at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, uploaded for portfolio purposes.

This project features two main phases of a compiler: the lexical analyzer and syntactical analyzer.

Within each subfolder, running the command `cargo doc --open` will open an HTML webpage containing well-formatted documentation.
